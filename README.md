The goal of this project was to explore and experiment with different sorting algorithms to find a simple yet efficient method for sorting a stack with minimal operations.

I gradually tried and compared three sorting techniques:

Radix Sort

Quick Sort

K-sort (a customized or variant sorting approach)

After testing and optimization, I managed to sort 500 random numbers using approximately 5,000 operations, balancing simplicity and efficiency.
